# coding_puzzles
Competition practice &amp; submissions, pychallenge, etc

I figured I might as well make a collection of these, especially because I plan on making boilerplate code for competitions and helpful scripts.

Odds are I'll clean or rewrite solutions on this repo, so expect that any solutions I actually submitted were uglier.
