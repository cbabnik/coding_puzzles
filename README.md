## Google Competitions

Google competitions use **python3.5**. Sometimes something more powerful is desired. **C++** is a good backup to have ready.

Google uses an interactive tool for some back and forth communication problems. This changed between 2019 and 2020.

The following python modules are available on Google's systems
* all stdlib
* numpy 1.16.2
* scipy 1.2.1
